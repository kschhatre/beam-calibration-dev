**Optional**: Sid Feygin (Stealth Startup, Berkeley Lab alum)  
**Recurring**: Mondays, 10 am PST  

**University Thesis Supervisor**: Prof. Mikhail Itskov, KM, RWTH Aachen University  
**University Advisor**: Markus Hillg√§rtner, KM, RWTH Aachen University  


## Week 46
 
+ Arrival, onboarding, introduction
+ BEAM/ MatSim 101

## Week 47
 
+ Preliminary tasks discussion
+ Getting BEAM running on local machine, trying configurations for beamville, sf-light experiments
+ Troubleshooting setup problems
+ Introduction to the Calibration problems, getting familiar to old setup, comparing external frameworks 

## Week 48
 
+ Running base setups and comparison between Microsoft Neural Network Intelligence framework/ HyperOpt, raytune framework from RISELab (UC Berkeley)
+ *To be started*: Getting started with setting up BEAM API for external framework  
+ *Scrap*: Polynomial regression with grid search

## Week 49
 
+ [BISTRO paper](http://bistro.its.berkeley.edu/assets/download/pdfs/BISTRO_paper.pdf)
+ Familiarizing oneself with:
    + [Bayesian optimization](http://krasserm.github.io/2018/03/21/bayesian-optimization/)
    + [Extrapolation of learning curves](http://aad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/papers/15-IJCAI-Extrapolation_of_Learning_Curves.pdf)
+ Technical write up of a problem statement on Overleaf (Conceptual understanding, development of ubiquitous language, all relevant objects identification and their labels etc.)

+ **Overall goals**:
    + Develop a test framework for BEAM.
    + Familiarize oneself with Scala syntax and understand the SigOpt branch.
    + Get SigOpt simulation running, analyze how convergence is achieved.  

## Week 50
 
+ [Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/python/ray/tune) - BEAM interface 
    + BayesOpt integration 
    + Early stop (ongoing)

## Week 51
 
+ Parallel Bayesian Optimization with Early stop (Ongoing)
