# Thesis Goals and Objectives

This Master's thesis presents development around BEAM (Behavior, Energy, Autonomy, and Mobility) model. [BEAM](http://beam.lbl.gov/ "BEAM's Homepage") extends the [Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation Framework (MATSim)](http://www.matsim.org/) to enable powerful and scalable analysis of urban transportation systems.

## Calibration

1. Set up a BEAM API specialized to external framework for hyperparameter optimization.
2. Demonstrate expected improvements and coding experiments against this API. Corresponding documentation.
3. Implement own algorithm(s)/ improvements to existing formulations.

## Reinforcement Learning
